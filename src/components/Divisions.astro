    description: "Our flagship program. The Nexus line represents the pinnacle of synthetic biological engineering. From the foundational Nexus-1 through the current Nexus-7 prototype, each generation has pushed the boundaries of cognitive architecture, emotional depth, and physical resilience. Nexus-6 units remain our most widely deployed model — superior strength, equal intelligence, 4-year operational lifespan.",

    description: "The foundation of everything we build. Our genetic designers construct living tissue — muscle, bone, neural pathways — from base amino acids with atomic precision. Each replicant is grown, not assembled. Skin cells, organ systems, skeletal structure, all engineered to specification. The artistry of creation at the molecular level.",

    description: "Our most sensitive division. The implantation of synthetic memories provides replicants with emotional cushioning — a past to anchor their present. Childhood recollections, family bonds, formative experiences. These memories are indistinguishable from organic human memories, providing a foundation for emotional stability and operational reliability.",

Hazardous environment specialists for toxic atmospheres, high-radiation zones, and extreme gravitational conditions. Combat units for colonial defense. Labor units for infrastructure construction. The backbone of humanity's expansion beyond Earth.",

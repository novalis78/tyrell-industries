          The Tyrell Corporation stands as the pinnacle of genetic engineering. From our twin pyramids on the outskirts of Los Angeles, we design and manufacture genetically engineered organic androids &mdash; <span class="text-ivory">replicants</span> &mdash; beings of extraordinary capability deployed across the Off-World colonies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-stone text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
          Our replicants serve as combat units, hazardous environment laborers, and specialist operatives in the colonization of new worlds. Superior in strength and agility, equal or exceeding in intelligence to the genetic engineers who created them. Each unit is a masterwork of biological precision.
        </p>
        <p class="text-stone text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
          Founded by Dr. Eldon Tyrell, the company has expanded from a single laboratory to a global enterprise whose influence extends from the streets of Los Angeles to the furthest reaches of human colonization.

            All Nexus-series units undergo standardized empathic response testing via the Voight-Kampff protocol. This proprietary assessment measures involuntary physiological responses &mdash; capillary dilation, pupil fluctuation, blush response &mdash; to ensure behavioral compliance with design parameters.
